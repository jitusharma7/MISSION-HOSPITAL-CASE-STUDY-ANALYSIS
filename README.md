## Overview
Mission Hospital is considering adoption of fixed package pricing make its pricing policies more transparent while providing the best care available to its patients. Thereby satisfying needs of both patients and hospitals.Currently the hospital are facing challenges in estimatin pricing package to be given to patients at time of admission.Hospital is required to build a model to help the hospital determine the approximate cost associated with the patientâ€™s treatment which is calculated on the basis of patient's clinical and non-clinical information available at the time of admission, so that the Hospital can charge the patient accordingly.

## AIM
The aim of project is to build a modell approach to identify the key factors which are respnsibel for total cost of treatment.

## Approach'
Following CRISP-DM approach to build a linear regression model.

## Conclusion


The Regression equations for the above mentioned four models are as follows:
Model :
Total cost to hospital = 7161 + 335.4*(Body Height) + 4680*(Total length of stay) + 22940*(Length of stay in ICU) + 1.73*(cost of implant)

.With the accurcy of 84% of the model, the significatnvariables which are key factor to drive the the total length of stay, length of stay in ICU and cost of implant.with these variables, any one of the following variables can be used: Age, height or weight.
